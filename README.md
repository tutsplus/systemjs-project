# [Universal Module Loading With SystemJS][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


SystemJS is a module loader that supports all of the most common JavaScript module formats in use today. Not only that, but with plugins, SystemJS can let you load assets like CSS and images as if they were ES6 modules.

In this course you'll learn all about SystemJS and JSPM. You'll see how to start a new project with SystemJS and how to configure plugins. Along the way, you'll see how to use SystemJS for compiling and loading styles and for loading older 3rd-party libraries as if they were ES6 modules. You'll also learn about JSPM, a package manager that works with SystemJS.

## Source Files Description:

The starter files for this course consist of an example application with a single ES2015 class in the **app** folder, and a very simple SCSS file in a folder called **scss**. There is also an almost empty HTML file. There are also the Git regulars like the **.gitignore** file, a **README** markdown file and a **package.json** project file. We'll build upon these starter files throughout the course.
